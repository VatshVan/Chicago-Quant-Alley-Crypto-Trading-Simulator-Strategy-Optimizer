# Chicago Quant Alley: Crypto Trading Simulator & Strategy Optimizer

**Chicago Quant Alley** is a **crypto trading simulator and strategy optimizer** that bridges academic concepts from stochastic finance with real-world crypto markets. The project allows you to simulate, backtest, and optimize derivatives strategies using historical data, stochastic modeling, and reinforcement-based tuning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

This repository includes:
- Historical data collection from real crypto exchanges
- Strategy implementation for crypto forwards and options
- Backtesting engine with performance evaluation metrics
- Simulation framework using stochastic models
- Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms for parameter tuning and adaptive strategy optimization

## Weekly Progress

### Foundations of Quant Trading  
- Read: _**Quantitative Trading**_ by Ernest P. Chan  
- Key concepts covered:
  - Strategy design and execution architecture
  - Risk management and capital allocation
  - Building a research and execution pipeline

---

### Data Collection  
- Collected **Options** and **Forwards** data from [Delta Exchange API](https://www.delta.exchange/)  
- Cleaned and stored data in structured formats (`pandas` DataFrames and `.parquet`)  
- Built utilities for querying, transforming, and visualizing this data  

---

### Theoretical Foundations  
- Completed NPTEL courses:
  - [Probability and Statistics â€“ IIT Kanpur](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111104089)
  - [Introduction to Research â€“ IIT Madras](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/109104104)
- Reading in progress: _Stochastic Finance with Python_ by Avishek Nag  
- Key focus:
  - Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
  - Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion (GBM)
  - Option pricing theory

---

### Simulator Development  
- Implemented Python-based **core simulation engine** for trading  
- Modeled crypto asset price paths using stochastic processes (e.g., GBM)  
- Developed modular system for testing custom strategies on synthetic and real data  
- Plug-and-play strategy interface created for future extension

---

### Strategy Optimization with MAB  
- Integrated **Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms** (e.g., Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Exp3)  
- Simulated different reward environments (stationary & adversarial)  
- Used bandits to optimize:
  - Strike price selection
  - Entry/exit timing
  - Hedging ratios
- Added performance plots and logging to analyze convergence behavior of bandit arms  
- Compared MAB-optimized vs. static strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and win rate
