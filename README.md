# Chicago Quant Alley: Crypto Trading Simulator & Strategy Optimizer

**Chicago Quant Alley** is a crypto trading simulator and strategy optimizer designed for backtesting, tuning, and evaluating trading strategies on historical data. This project aims to bridge academic foundations in stochastic finance with practical crypto markets, enabling robust simulation and testing of derivatives strategies.

---

## Project Overview:

This repository will evolve over time to include:
- Historical data collection and processing
- Strategy implementation for forwards and options
- Backtesting and performance evaluation
- Simulation frameworks using stochastic models
- Optimization of strategy parameters

---

## Weekly Progress:

### Week 1: Foundations of Quant Trading  
- Read: _**Quantitative Trading: How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business**_  
  by **Ernest P. Chan**  
- Key concepts covered:
  - Basics of strategy design and execution
  - Risk management in quant trading
  - Building a research and execution platform

### Week 2: Data Collection  
- Collected historical **Options** and **Forwards** data from **Delta Exchange** via their API.
- Cleaned and stored data in structured formats for further use in simulation and modeling.
- **Week 2 assignment** is yet to be given.

### Week 3: Theoretical Foundations  
- Completed the following NPTEL courses:
  - [Probability and Statistics – IIT Kanpur](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111104089)
  - [Introduction to Research – IIT Madras](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/109104104)
- Currently reading:
  _**Stochastic Finance with Python: Design Financial Models from Probabilistic Perspective**_  
  by **Avishek Nag** (from the college library)  
- Preparing to design the simulation framework based on stochastic modeling concepts covered in the book.

### Week 4: Simulator Development _(Upcoming)_
- Begin implementing the core simulator in Python for crypto derivatives trading.
- Focus Areas:
  - Modeling asset price paths under uncertainty
  - Implementing option pricing logic
  - Designing reusable components for strategy testing and backtesting
